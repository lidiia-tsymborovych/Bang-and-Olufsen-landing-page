# B&O-Inspired Landing Page

A responsive and semantic landing page inspired by the “B&O” design from my Frontend course. Built with **HTML5**, **SCSS**, and deployed via **GitHub Pages** (or Netlify/Vercel).

# Project Details

- **Design Choice**: B&O landing layout from course materials
- **Tech Stack**: HTML5, SCSS (main.scss), CSS
- **Approach**:
  - Built the page block by block following the lesson videos
  - Implemented relative `background-image: url()` paths for assets
  - Ensured semantic structure and responsive design
  - Used a checklist to guide elements and layout instead of pixel-perfect fidelity
  - Deployed and created a Pull Request with a live demo link

# Features

- Responsive layout across desktop and mobile
